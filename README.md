- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ariana-Jane
- 👀 I’m interested in Graphic Design.
- 🌱 I am currently attending college earning
 my Associates Degree in Graphic Design. I 
have a working knowledge of Microsoft Office 
and the Adobe programs Photoshop, Illustrator, 
and InDesign. I know HTML, I am learning CSS 
now, and Javascript will be next. What I may 
lack in experience, I make up for with 
innovation and reliability. Although I still 
have a lot to learn about design and marketing, 
I am a fast learner, and I have a real passion 
for using technology to make people's lives easier.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that 
will help me succeed in this industry.
